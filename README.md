# Myproject
Here I have created the to-do list using ASP.net MVC.
The CRUD has been used to execute it using Entity framework.
The database is Microsoft SQL with the entity as ID, Title, Description and status.
The application can be using index.cshtml(View-->>Myproject-->>index.cshtml).
The different operation can be performed are add, delete, edit, details
The is the image of to-do list
